          <figcaption>Hi ma'am, ako tong favourite mo kimmy, I want to thank you the most ngayong School Year. Kahit anong kabaliwan yung ginagawa ko sa room is sinasakyan mo *Minsan*. Your Teaching Skills make me want to be a teacher more and be like you. I want to connect with my future students like we did with my classmates. I appreciate all the things you've done for us, especially me. I'll visit you sometime when I have time. Once again,Â  thank you very much for this happy and wonderful school year with you!</figcaption>
